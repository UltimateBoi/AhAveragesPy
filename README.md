Bad implemtation / conversion of my 2020 auction averages (which was made into a sniper). Averaging system is extremely (4 years) outdated so dont trust. Purely for example / testing currently as of 03/25

### Currently the database includes over 7200 minutes (120 hours) of finished auctions (7200 api refreshes). Currently limited to about 1 request every 5 minutes due to githubs limit on how github actions chron scheduler work (1 request every 5 minutes)

### 1,127,999 unique BIN auctions that contain a buyer as of 11:40 03/06/2025 since *roughly* beginning of march 2025
