Bad implemtation / conversion of my 2020 auction averages (which was made into a sniper). Averaging system is extremely (4 years) outdated so dont trust. Purely for example / testing currently as of 03/25

### Currently the database includes over 1800 minutes (30 hours) of finished auctions (1800 api refreshes). Currently limited to about 1 request every 5 minutes due to githubs limit on how github actions chron scheduler work (1 request every 5 minutes)

### 255,678 unique BIN auctions that contain a buyer as of 12:55 GMT 04/04/25 since *roughly* beginning of march 2025
